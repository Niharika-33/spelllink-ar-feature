# SpellLink – Real-Time AR Spell Dueling 🪄

This repository contains my submission for the **Product Management Intern assignment** at **Flam**.

## 📌 Feature Overview

**SpellLink** is a proposed real-time AR dueling feature for Flam’s magical universe. It introduces gesture-based 1v1 spell battles, allowing users to challenge friends, select spells, and engage in immersive AR gameplay with magical VFX and social replay sharing.

This feature aligns with Flam’s mission to promote social-first, camera-powered mixed reality.

📄 The original proposal is included here as `SpellLink_Feature_Proposal.pdf`.

## 📈 What This Repo Adds (Beyond the PDF)

To complement the written proposal and strengthen product insight, this repo includes:

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `gesture-system.md` | Expanded notes on how gesture recognition would work, and how the system would improve accuracy over time |
| `user-flow-diagram.png` | Diagram illustrating the flow from invite → duel → replay |

## 🧠 Problem Summary

> “Casting spells alone is fun, but I wish I could actually duel my friends like in the movies.”

Users crave deeper interaction in the magical AR experience. SpellLink transforms passive spellcasting into dynamic, social gameplay — enabling repeat usage, engagement, and shareable moments.
